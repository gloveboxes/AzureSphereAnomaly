# Azure Sphere DevX library

The DevX library accelerates your development and will help to improve your developer experience building  Azure Sphere applications.

The DevX library addresses many common Azure Sphere scenarios with a focus on:

1. IoT Hub messaging
1. IoT Hub Device Twins and Direct Methods
1. Intercore Messaging
1. Event Timers
1. GPIO.

The DevX library will help reduce the amount of code you write and improve readability and long-term application maintenance.

The focus of the Azure Sphere DevX library is the communications and simplification of common scenarios when building Azure Sphere applications.
